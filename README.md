### **Intro**
  
This project was designed to be a grand step in learning true responsive web design; swapping layouts between desktop, tablet, and mobile seemlessly.
  
### **Description**
  
Around the US features a profile card at the top of the page, with a user image, name, description, an 'edit' button, and an 'add' button. Below that are a section of cards featuring landscape photos with a 'like' button added to them. Both the header and landscape photo cards use a variety of *CSS Grid* and *Flexbox* to auto maintain display ratios when changing displays.

### **Intro**
  
This project was designed to help take grand steps in learning true *responsive web design* and integrating *JavaScript* with *HTML* and *CSS*; The first main focus was swapping layouts between desktop, tablet, and mobile seemlessly. Then, programming all elements of the webpage to be interactive to the user.
  
### **Overview**
  
Around the US features a profile card at the top of the page, with a user image, name, description, an 'edit' button, and an 'add' button. Clicking the edit button allows you to change the User Name and Job Title at the top of the page. Clicking the add button allows you to enter a new Place card into the section below. The forms to edit any sections of the website have integrated validation via JavaScript, and basic user workflow integration, such as using the Escape key or clicking away from a window to close out of it. Below that are a section of cards featuring landscape photos with a 'like' button added to them. Clicking the like button will trigger a fill state, and clicking the card image will open a window for you to view the location in full. Both the header, landscape photo cards, and all pop up windows use a variety of *CSS Grid* and *Flexbox* to auto maintain display ratios when changing displays.
